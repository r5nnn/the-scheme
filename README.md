scheming you dont want to know what goes on down there
## list of projects included
### calculator.py
calculator made with tkinter that uses super inefficient arrays to add subract and multiply numbers (no dividing floats are not a thing). pretty much this project failed after the code i made was so messy i gave up wanting to work on it
### emoji wars.py
WIP
### evil duplication program.py
a program as requested by a classmate to spam a bunch of files onto the pc (not using external python modules so it can be run at school)
### lets ping, lets pong.py
currently my most complicated project, it is a ping pong game made in tkinter. suuuper buggy and unpolished but it works and thats all im willing to put myself through. after this i gave up on tkinter and moved to pygame - what a relief
### limbo.py
totally failed project to create the limbo keys from hit geometry dash level limbo after i realised or rather ok ill admit it im too bad to make or realise a way to make tkinter windows interact and move simultaneously
### mouse minor annoyance.py
the OG first project ever. the first python module i learnt was ctypes in order to mess around with moving the mouse. features an option to pick between many fun mouse annoyances with the most complicated being picking a point on your screen to act as gravity and have your mouse gravitate towards it (buggy). others include having the screen borders mirrored, or shutting down the pc
